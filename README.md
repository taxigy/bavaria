## Short-term (aka expensive) rental

Airbnb.

## Registration of residence

Once you're in Germany, you have to go to Kreisverwaltungsreferat (KVR) and register.

It's a quite complicated part, because

1. To register your residence, you need to have a permanent address.
1. You have to register your residence in the first 2 weeks after arrival.
1. It's completely impossible to get any permanent address in the first two weeks.

Airbnb is okay, but you have to make sure your host is aware of your issue and
is ready to accept snail mail even after you leave. After you register, KVR will
send you a bunch of documents by post, and getting them both issued and
delivered may take weeks and months. You may have left the apartment by the time
it arrives, hence complications.

Since March 2017, you have to bring a special document, signed by your host,
that proves the address, date of arrival and all the guests.

There's a cheat: if you come to KVR with a kid, you can ask for a special number
in queue. With this number, whatever the length of the queue is, you'll be able
to enter much quicker. To do this, just enter the door in the waiting area and
say that you came to register address with a child. The officer will give you a
number (green talon). Now wait until you're invited.

Todo:

- [ ] Book an apartment on Airbnb and inform the host that you'll receive post, probably after your departure from the apartment.
- [ ] Ask the host to fill in the document that proves that you stay at the apartment and reachable at a certain address.
- [ ] Find nearest KVR to your next address and go there.

## Insurance

To apply for public insurance, you need to visit a website of any of the
insurance providers in Germany, download PDFs for application for you and fill
them in. After that, you need to print them and either fax or snail mail them
back to the insurance company. To make it work, you have to put your permanent
address.

You need your own insurance getting approved and issued to you to apply for
insurance for your family, because, when doing the latter, you need to put your
SSN in the application form. So, apply for yours; wait; then apply for family
members'.

## Long-term (aka cheap) rental

It's hard.

In Germany, when you move into an apartment, it's considered you move there for
ages. At the same time, the market is regulated and competitive. Hence the
complications: landlords receive hundreds of applications and need to pick the
most reliable tenant.

In Germany, credit score is a thing. Your credit score depends on your salary
and payment history. When you just moved to Germany, it's impossible to get a
SCHUFA rating. Landlords prefer potential tenants who are proven by SCHUFA. You
get it.

There are websites where all the landlords post all the apartments and houses:

- [ImmobilienScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/)
- [ImmoWelt](https://www.immowelt.de/)
- [WG-Gesucht](http://www.wg-gesucht.de/)

There are also more expensive options for shorter terms (6–36 months):

- [Mr. Lodge](https://www.mrlodge.com/)

And of course, Airbnb.
