## Regular kids activities

For children under 6, there are two: Kindergarten and Tagesmutter. The former
is, well, kindergarten, while the latter is a light option when a private
pedagogue would establish a hosted few-hours activities on a weekday basis.

German-only kindergartens are prevalent, but it can be super tough for a toddler
to attend these. Bilingual kindergartens are better, but almost none of them are
public.

Prices:

- public: free, locals consider this the best option,
- private: €650–1000 per month, depending on hours per day, days per week, the
  location and whatever else the owner considers worth asking for
