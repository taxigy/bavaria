# Germany

## Phone number

Go to T-Mobile (Telekom) and get a prepaid SIM. €20 first, €15 every month for
"L" plan for 1.5GB data and paid calls and SMS.

To refill the SIM, go to [the "Aufladebetrag auswählen"
website](https://www.telekomaufladen.de/) or use ["Prepaid Aufladung"
app](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/prepaid-aufladung/id881818215?mt=8). On the
website, it's possible to set up automatic payments.

To save time, just enable automatic payments.

Todo:

- [ ] Move from prepaid to long-term contract (why?).

## Short-term (aka expensive) rental

Airbnb.

## Registration of residence

Once you're in Germany, you have to go to Kreisverwaltungsreferat (KVR) and register.

It's a quite complicated part, because

1. To register your residence, you need to have a permanent address.
1. You have to register your residence in the first 2 weeks after arrival.
1. It's completely impossible to get any permanent address in the first two weeks.

Airbnb is okay, but you have to make sure your host is aware of your issue and
is ready to accept snail mail even after you leave. After you register, KVR will
send you a bunch of documents by post, and getting them both issued and
delivered may take weeks and months. You may have left the apartment by the time
it arrives, hence complications.

Since March 2017, you have to bring **a special document**, signed by your host,
that proves the address, date of arrival and all the guests:
["Wohnungsgeberbestätigung zur Vorlage bei der
Meldebehörde"](https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dam/jcr:2c08134d-c663-452b-9eb5-3ce859ba5d37/Wohnungsgeberbest&auml;tigung_Internet.pdf).

There's a cheat: if you come to KVR with a kid, you can ask for a special number
in queue. With this number, whatever the length of the queue is, you'll be able
to enter much quicker. To do this, just enter the door in the waiting area and
say that you came to register address with a child. The officer will give you a
number (green talon). Now wait until you're invited.

Todo:

- [ ] Book an apartment on Airbnb and inform the host that you'll receive post, probably after your departure from the apartment.
- [ ] Ask the host to fill in the document that proves that you stay at the apartment and reachable at a certain address.
- [ ] Find nearest KVR to your next address and go there.

## Insurance

To apply for public insurance, you need to visit a website of any of the
insurance providers in Germany, download PDFs for application for you and fill
them in. After that, you need to print them and either fax or snail mail them
back to the insurance company. To make it work, you have to put your permanent
address.

You need your own insurance getting approved and issued to you to apply for
insurance for your family, because, when doing the latter, you need to put your
SSN in the application form. So, apply for yours; wait; then apply for family
members'.

- [BKK Mobil Oil](https://www.bkk-mobil-oil.de/)

## Bank account

To receive a salary and be able to transfer money for your future long-term
rental, you need a bank account that would provide valid name, IBAN and BIC, in
EUR currency.

## Tax ID

You receive one from Finanzamt by mail after you first register in Germany,
after 4+ weeks. If you went to register with the whole family (which is the
right way to do), all members receive envelopes with their Tax IDs.

In case you didn't, whatever the reason, you can always request your Tax ID
again to get it by post to your permanent address in Germany. You need to go to
Bundeszentralamt für Steuern website and [fill in the form to request
re-delivery](https://www.bzst.de/DE/Steuern_National/Steuerliche_Identifikationsnummer/ID_Eingabeformular/ID_Node.html).

No need to go to Finanzamt to get Tax ID, as it will be sent to you by mail.

If you are married and provide corresponding documents first time you register
at KVR, you and your spouse will be both assigned tax category 4 (short: 4/4).
In case you want to reassign it from 4/4 to 3/5 or 5/3, you have to bring a
special paper (TODO what's its name?) filled in and signed by both partners. You
can also do this by post, and the address to send to is "from" address on the
letters you receive when you get your Tax ID.

## Long-term (aka cheap) rental

It's hard.

In Germany, when you move into an apartment, it's considered you move there for
ages. At the same time, the market is regulated and competitive. Hence the
complications: landlords receive hundreds of applications and need to pick the
most reliable tenant.

In Germany, credit score is a thing. Your credit score depends on your salary
and payment history. When you just moved to Germany, it's impossible to get a
SCHUFA rating. Landlords prefer potential tenants who are proven by SCHUFA. You
get it.

There are websites where all the landlords post all the apartments and houses:

- [ImmobilienScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/)
- [ImmoWelt](https://www.immowelt.de/)
- [WG-Gesucht](http://www.wg-gesucht.de/)

There are also more expensive options for shorter terms (6–36 months):

- [Mr. Lodge](https://www.mrlodge.com/)

And of course, Airbnb.

There's no strict price tag, however, what is good, is that any apartment, no
matter the number of rooms, is priced against area, typically €15–20 for square
meter. Apartments on first floors (sometimes marked as "0 von N", zeroth of
many) sometimes have access to a private garden, which is damn good. Apartments
on topmost floors sometimes have access to roof (rare) and generally give you
the joy of triangular ceiling (if you like).

First thing you do is decide what kind of an apartment you're looking for. A
2-room apartment in Germany is somewhat like 1–room in the US: you have one
separate room and one room combined with cooking space. For a family with a kid,
to stay sane, it would be a good idea to look for a 3–room apartment.

One more thing about apartments is 2.5-room, or generally "N.5-room" apartments.
By law, a room can only be called a "0.5-room" if its area is less than 10
square meters. If it's 10.1, it's a room. If it's 10.0, it's a half-room. A room
being a half-room doesn't make itself cheaper or more expensive, because total
area is what matters. If you plan to use it as a kids room, don't tell it to
your potential landlord.

Next, you start bombing potential landlords with messages that say

- what good a person you are,
- what gross or net income you have (better net),
- that your spouse isn't a student, because nobody likes students,
- that you don't have pets and also you don't smoke (and don't vape either),
- that you have a working contract (in case you do),
- that you're eager to visit the apartment and see it, and
- that you have SCHUFA (if you do), three last salary slips (no idea what to do
  if not) and Mieterselbstauskunft (sort of mandatory).

If things go well and you reach the next dungeon level, you're long-listed by
landlords or agents to visit the apartment. The sign of it is either a phone
call or an email. Most landlords don't speak English, but most agents do, so
that's actually a secondary sign of an agent. Typically, you don't have a
choice: you're either given a certain time to visit an apartment for about 30
minutes, otherwise good luck finding another one.

If you are lucky to get invited to an apartment viewing, dress up and don't be
late. I mean, seriously. Go there, tell about yourself (the same stuff as in
your application letter), ask questions.

There are good questions to ask during the first meeting:

- if there's landline phone or maybe even internet connection in the apartment,
  or at least of there _was_ one (because most internet providers still use
  ADSL),
- is kitchen furnishing included (because sometimes it is),
- TODO what else?

## High-speed internet connection at home

TBD.

## Regular kids activities

For children under 6, there are two: Kindergarten and Tagesmutter. The former
is, well, kindergarten, while the latter is a light option when a private
pedagogue would establish a hosted few-hours activities on a weekday basis.

German-only kindergartens are prevalent, but it can be super tough for a toddler
to attend these. Bilingual kindergartens are better, but almost none of them are
public.

Prices:

- public: free, locals consider this the best option,
- private: €650–1000 per month, depending on hours per day, days per week, the
  location and whatever else the owner considers worth asking for

Todo:

- [ ] Find one.

## Public transport

Go to subway, buy a monthly card depending on your daily route. If you live and
work close to the city center, it's _IsarCard 9 uhr, Innenraum_, about €60 per
month, that gives you ability to use all the public transport (not just subway)
within first four rings (read further).

The greater Munich area is divided into 4 zones, each consisting of 4 rings, so
16 rings in total: [see official
doc](http://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-fares/tariff-structure/rings/index.html).
You can download detailed maps there as well.

Take your daily route, find stations on the map, find what rings these stations
belong to, and buy a corresponding card. The more rings, the more expensive, so
it's of your best interest to understand this thing.

You can also use an app to buy tickets, which is cool because a ticket, which is
a piece of paper, can get worn out or lost. The phone can also get lost, of
course, so choose wisely. The app is ["MVV
Companion"](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/mvv-companion/id388686726?mt=8).
