# Home internet connection

Most buildings have proper infrastructure that supports German internet. The
funny part of it is that proper infrastructure is landline phone, and German
internet is ADSL connection. Which means really bad upload but moderately fast
download.

Just find a solid provider and apply for connection. In Munich, a good one is
M-Net.
