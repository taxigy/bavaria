# Mobile phone

Go to Telekom (looks like T-Mobile) sales point and get a prepaid SIM. €20
first, €15 every 4 weeks for "L" plan for 1.5GB data and paid calls and SMS.

To refill the SIM, go to [the "Aufladebetrag auswählen"
website](https://www.telekomaufladen.de/) or use ["Prepaid Aufladung"
app](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/prepaid-aufladung/id881818215?mt=8). On the
website, it's possible to set up automatic payments.

To save time, just enable automatic payments. Once you did, make sure that card
balance is sufficient for the automatic payments, otherwise you'll have to do
this manually. Most German services only attempt to charge once, Telekom isn't
an exception.

Over time, your life will naturally organize in a way that you don't depend on
mobile phone anyway. Most bureaucratic things are done via snail mail or
physical visit. Wi-Fi is ubiquitous. So stick with prepaid plan just to subrtact
the amount of extra work once you decide to stop using it.
