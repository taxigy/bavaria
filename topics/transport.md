# Transport

## Public transport

Go to subway, buy a monthly card depending on your daily route and schedule.

In Munich, if you live and work close to the city center, it's _IsarCard 9 uhr,
Innenraum_, about â‚¬60 per month, that gives you ability to use all the public
transport (not just subway) within first four rings (read further).

The greater Munich area is divided into 4 zones, each consisting of 4 rings, so
16 rings in total: [see official
doc](http://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-fares/tariff-structure/rings/index.html).
You can download detailed maps there as well.

Take your daily route, find stations on the map, find what rings these stations
belong to, and buy a corresponding card. The more rings, the more expensive, so
it's of your best interest to understand this thing.

You can also use an app to buy tickets, which is cool because a ticket, which is
a piece of paper, can get worn out or lost. The phone can also get lost, of
course, so choose wisely. The app is ["MVV
