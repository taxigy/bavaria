# Child benefits

If you pay taxes in Germany and have children under 25, you are
automatically eligible to receive child benefit. Country of
origin and current visa status doesn't matter.

To apply for child benefits, you need to

1. Make a paper copy of your kids' birth certificates.
1. Print one application form and as many appendix forms as you have
   children under 25.
1. Fill in all the things and send by post.

Why paper copy of birth certificates? Because chances are you're
applying for the first time, and Kindergeldkasse just needs to
know that the kids you apply for actually exist (duh!) and assign
them with numbers and stuff.

What application forms? Follow this article on the web:

Where to send? Knowing your postal code (PLZ) and city (Ort), you
can look it up on
[Familienkasse-Info.de](https://familienkasse-info.de). For
example, if your postal code is 80335 and city is Munich, open

<https://www.familienkasse-info.de/zustaendige-familienkasse.php?plz=80335&ort=MÃ¼nchen>

There's also a search field on the right where you can type your
postal code and look up the right address of Kindergeldkasse und
Familienkasse responsible for your address.
