# Health insurance

In Germany, if you are an adult, you contribute to public insurance. Even if you
don't work, you have to. The amount of contribution depends on person's salary,
and generally it feels like the most democratic thing in Germany.

What gives you access to healthcare is Gesundheitskarte, a plastic card with
your photo, numbers, and chip.

To apply for public insurance, you can't do everything online. Snail mail is
going to be involved inevitable. But to initiate the process, use a website. You
need to visit a website of any of the insurance providers in Germany, download
PDFs for application for you and fill them in. After that, you need to print
them and either fax or snail mail them back to the insurance company. To make it
work, you have to put your permanent address.

You need your own insurance getting approved and issued to you to apply for
insurance for your family, because, when doing the latter, you need to put your
SSN in the application form. So, apply for yours; wait; then apply for family
members'.

When applying for family members, you need to prove that they are your spouse and your kids. You also need to prove they live with you. So an insurance company will ask for two documents that prove it, and only once you send them, will your family members receive first a public insurance number and then plastic cards.

Until your family members have received their cards, it is possible (although
may be complicated) to apply for healthcare for them using your
Gesundheitskarte.
