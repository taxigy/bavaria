# Registration of residence

Once you're in Germany, you have to go to Kreisverwaltungsreferat (KVR) and register your residence.

It's a quite complicated part, because

1. To register your residence, you need to have a permanent address.
1. You have to register your residence in the first 2 weeks after arrival.
1. It's completely impossible to get any permanent address in the first two
weeks. (you're lucky if you get it within first 3 months, [see about
renting](./accomodation.md)).

Airbnb is okay, but you have to make sure your host is aware of your issue and
is ready to accept snail mail even after you leave. It means putting your name
on their postbox, because otherwise it's impossible to receive post: no room or
apartment numbers, names only.

After you register, KVR will send you a bunch of documents by post, and getting
them both issued and delivered may take weeks and months. You may have left the
apartment by the time it arrives, hence complications.

Since March 2017, you have to bring **a special document**, signed by your host,
that proves the address, date of arrival and all the guests:

## Hacking the line at KVR

There's a cheat: if you come to KVR with a kid, you can ask for a special number
in queue. With this number, whatever the length of the queue is, you'll be able
to enter much quicker. To do this, just enter the door in the waiting area and
say that you came to register address with a child. The officer will give you a
number (green talon). Now wait until you're invited.
