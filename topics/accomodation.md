# Accomodation

There are four ways:

1. Hostel, if you are young and adventurous.
2. Hotel.
3. Airbnb.
4. The real apartment rental.

## Airbnb

Airbnb is expensive. €2500 for a "Kellerraum" (sub-floor apartment) is normal,
no matter how far from city center.

## Long-term (slightly cheaper) rental

It's hard.

In Germany, when you move into an apartment, it's considered you move there for
ages. At the same time, the market is regulated and competitive. Hence the
complications: landlords receive hundreds of applications and need to pick the
most reliable tenant.

In Germany, credit score is a thing. Your credit score depends on your salary
and payment history. When you just moved to Germany, it's impossible to get a
SCHUFA rating. Landlords prefer potential tenants who are proven by SCHUFA. You
get it.

There are websites where all the landlords post all the apartments and houses:

- [ImmobilienScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/)
- [ImmoWelt](https://www.immowelt.de/)
- [WG-Gesucht](http://www.wg-gesucht.de/)

There are also more expensive options for shorter terms (6–36 months):

And of course, Airbnb.

There's no strict price tag, however, what is good, is that any apartment, no
matter the number of rooms, is priced against area, typically €15–20 for square
meter. Apartments on first floors (sometimes marked as "0 von N", zeroth of
many) sometimes have access to a private garden, which is damn good. Apartments
on topmost floors sometimes have access to roof (rare) and generally give you
the joy of triangular ceiling (if you like).

First thing you do is decide what kind of an apartment you're looking for. A
2-room apartment in Germany is somewhat like 1–room in the US: you have one
separate room and one room combined with cooking space. For a family with a kid,
to stay sane, it would be a good idea to look for a 3–room apartment.

One more thing about apartments is 2.5-room, or generally "N.5-room" apartments.
By law, a room can only be called a "0.5-room" if its area is less than 10
square meters. If it's 10.1, it's a room. If it's 10.0, it's a half-room. A room
being a half-room doesn't make itself cheaper or more expensive, because total
area is what matters. If you plan to use it as a kids room, don't tell it to
your potential landlord.

Next, you start bombing potential landlords with messages that say

- what good a person you are,
- what gross or net income you have (better net),
- that your spouse isn't a student, because nobody likes students,
- that you don't have pets and also you don't smoke (and don't vape either),
- that you have a working contract (in case you do),
- that you're eager to visit the apartment and see it, and
- that you have SCHUFA (if you do), three last salary slips (no idea what to do
  if not) and Mieterselbstauskunft (sort of mandatory).

If things go well and you reach the next dungeon level, you're long-listed by
landlords or agents to visit the apartment. The sign of it is either a phone
call or an email. Most landlords don't speak English, but most agents do, so
that's actually a secondary sign of an agent. Typically, you don't have a
choice: you're either given a certain time to visit an apartment for about 30
minutes, otherwise good luck finding another one.

If you are lucky to get invited to an apartment viewing, dress up and don't be
late. I mean, seriously. Go there, tell about yourself (the same stuff as in
your application letter), ask questions.

There are good questions to ask during the first meeting:

- if there's landline phone or maybe even internet connection in the apartment,
  or at least of there _was_ one (because most internet providers still use
  ADSL),
- is kitchen furnishing included (because sometimes it is),
- TODO what else?
