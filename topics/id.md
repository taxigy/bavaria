# Tax ID

In Germany, it's called "Identifikationsnummer" and works as both your unique
personal number and your tax ID.

You receive one from Finanzamt by mail after you first register in Germany,
after 4+ weeks. If you went to register with the whole family (which is the
right way to do), all members receive envelopes with their Tax IDs.

In case you didn't, whatever the reason, you can always request your Tax ID
again to get it by post to your permanent address in Germany. You need to go to
Bundeszentralamt f√ºr Steuern website and [fill in the form to request
re-delivery](https://www.bzst.de/DE/Steuern_National/Steuerliche_Identifikationsnummer/ID_Eingabeformular/ID_Node.html).

No need to go to Finanzamt to get Tax ID, as it will be sent to you by mail.

If you are married and provide corresponding documents first time you register
at KVR, you and your spouse will be both assigned tax category 4 (short: 4/4).
In case you want to reassign it from 4/4 to 3/5 or 5/3, you have to bring a
special paper (TODO what's its name?) filled in and signed by both partners. You
can also do this by post, and the address to send to is "from" address on the
letters you receive when you get your Tax ID.
